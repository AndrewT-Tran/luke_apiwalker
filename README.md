You have been given a task as a front-end developer to create a front-end app to navigate the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/).

In addition to the index route, you should have a route to display specific characters and a route to display specific planets. Here are a couple considerations to keep in mind:

*   Since the search form is shown on every route and we want to preserve its state across route changes, does it need to be rendered inside each route component?
*   Typically we pass an empty array as the second argument to our `useEffect` calls to ensure that the API request is only made once. How can we force the useEffect callback to also run when the ID for a given route pattern has changed? **Hint:** think about putting a variable inside that array.

By reading the Star Wars API documentation, create a User Interface that does the following tasks:

*   Create a dropdown menu that allows the user to choose the resource they are looking for

*   Next to the dropdown menu, create an input field that accepts a number that will be used to query a specific id.

*   Add a button to allow them to send a request to the API.

*   On submission, navigate to the appropriate route and render at least 4 attributes for that specific resource.

*   If the request is unsuccessful, create an error message that says "These aren't the droids you're looking for" with a picture of Obi-Wan Kenobi.

*   NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people", output the name of the character's homeworld (you may need to make another request)

*   NINJA BONUS: If the resource is "people" render a link to their homeworld (a specific planet). It's okay if the link text is simply "homeworld."

*   NINJA BONUS: Add additional resources aside from people and planets to the dropdown.
